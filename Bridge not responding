WinHue 3 beta 24 regularly crashes. I get messages "Bridge not responding". 
Although the IP adresse showing for the bridge is correct, it is impossible to pair it.
I have tried several times to reinstall WinHue, without success. Bridge responds OK I use RESTful interface.
The only solution is to reset the bridge to its factory settings.
Please help!
